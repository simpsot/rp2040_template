    <h1>RP2040 mcu pcb</h1>
    
    <p>
      This project template is the basis of a pcb using the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/">RP2040</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: due to the fact that the official 3D library does not include "long" or "stacking" female headers, the default Connector_PinSocket_2.54mm models were used.
